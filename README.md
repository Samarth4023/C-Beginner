# Beginner C++ Programs

Welcome to my collection of beginner C++ programs! This repository serves as a showcase of my initial journey into programming, where I explored the basics of C++ and developed foundational skills in coding.

## Motivation

Although my current focus is entirely on Python, AI, and Machine Learning, I believe that my experience with C++ has played a crucial role in shaping my understanding of programming concepts. This repository is a testament to my learning journey and serves as an inspiration for others who are just starting. By sharing these programs, I hope to:

- Demonstrate my early work and growth as a programmer.
- Provide useful examples and resources for beginners learning C++.
- Encourage others to document and share their learning journeys.

## Contents

This repository contains various beginner-level C++ programs, covering topics such as:

- Basic syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and strings
- Object-oriented programming concepts

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need a C++ compiler such as `g++` (part of GCC) or any integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C++.

### Compilation and Execution

You can compile and run any of the programs using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
./program_name
```

For example, to compile and run a program named `hello_world.cpp`, use:

```bash
g++ -o hello_world hello_world.cpp
./hello_world
```
